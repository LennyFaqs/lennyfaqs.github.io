Lenny Faqs mythos were stories created by the Spicy sausage monarchs depicting the server and their members
the mythos mainly focused on the Spicy sausage monarchs but other people occasionally can be seen in them too
One of the first incarnations of the mythos were the 3 horsemen of the apocalypse
the Spicy sausage monarchs were also known as the 3 pillars or the pillarmen
Magmakaj30 was known as pestilence
Margareth was known as the conquest
Alex was known as famine

During the paint.net challanges many depictions of these mythos were made

earliest versions of this meme consisted of the representations of the Spicy sausage monarchs on 3 pillars
Image
many references to these mythos can be seen in the server
one of them being the emojis of Margareths face with woke eyes called the conquest

a profile on tumblr named as Pestilence30 was made by Magmakaj30
the profile had the job of luring a certain person to Lenny Faqs but the plan never worked out in the end
a fourth horseman was proposed to have existed long ago that was killed and replaced by Diogenes the bot
it was supposed to be the death
face of Diogenes can be seen in multiple memes shown above
either as a seperate person or in a way a part of pestilence
where pestilance came death followed
