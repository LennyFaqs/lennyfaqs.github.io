In the beggining there was nothing
Lenny Faqs didnt yet exist and the spicy sausage monarch havent yet met
Until one fated day
In an age long gone one of the 3 spicy monarchs, called Magmakaj30 was playing tf2 when he suddenly got a trade offer
the offer was a heavily discounted shitty medigun
Magmakaj30 took it and decided to try acting like a toxic medic main for the rest of the match
he started flooding the chat with things like "WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU FUCKING FAGS?", or "ITS ALL YOUR FAULT YOU FAGS"
some found it annoying, some found it funny
one person found it fucking hilarious
that person was called Margareth
he asked Magmakaj30 to add him, and soon they started chatting
it was quite one sided, since Magmakaj30 couldnt care less about Margareth
yet soon Magmakaj30 gave up and decided to chat too
The word fag turned into a meme after what happened in tf2 and lenny spamming became insanely popular between these two
they memed around untill one day when Margareth was acting depressed
It turned out that he lost his dead of night
which was expensive by his standards
Magmakaj30 took it upon himself to get that back
he was pointed to the profile of Alex
The two of them began discussing what happened and what should be done
almost by luck, Alex decided to give back the dead of night to Margareth
and for some reason the 3 became friends
Thats when a pact was made
a cult was started
a group was formed
its name
was Lenny Fags
