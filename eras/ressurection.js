After the Purge on Lenny Faqs all rules were set back to how they were before the anime flooding, in other words, non existant
there was no more ownership of rooms or badges 
you could ask to get any emoji added, and it would be if it seemed to be good enough
the server gained more channels that had the purpose of sharing, unlike the neko and tiddy room or the glorious thighs room these rooms would share greentext stories or anime reccomendations
all channels meant for sharing were put in the sharing is caring cattegory
The server went back to being what it was meant to be
a free for all place to do anything you want
laugh with friends or sell cocaine, all was alright in Lenny Faqs
(for legal reasons thats a joke)
the server gained two new members, yugaj and negaj the neko uploaders
the server also got a bot that was named Diogenes the gaj dog
for some time some people thought that Diogenes the bot would replace the neko uploaders but that never happened
Things seemed to go back to how they were in pre-anime flooding period with some small changes for the better
a few new people joined
like john who later made a whole channel for lyric translations from croatian to english

or Cassette who became one of the regularly talking people
he was also present for some time in the anime flooding since he was from Anime Party but was kicked due to inactivity during The Purge
after being added again he started talking more and more finally becoming the most talkative non-spicy sausage monarch
Dankmemess asked to be let into Lenny Faqs again, but even after being accepted he became inactive on the server
Many other people have joined after seeing that they fit in, but many of them almost never talk leaving the spicy sausage monarchs and cassette the only active ones plus ryuggo or even doggo sometimes to drop in
not everything was going perfectly though
yugaj was becoming less and less active
and negaj outright left the server
there were less and less nekos uploaded to the neko and tiddy room
things seemed to dwindle a lot in Lenny Faqs 
Margareth would frequently leave and rejoin
things were once again in bad shape
then an argument broke out between Margareth and Alex that resulted in Margareth deleting the Neko and tiddy room on the 25th of March 2018 
a room that many people worked on for a long time
luckily Margareth already had the title of The Sauce Man
meaning he could find anything, anywhere
and that he had every single picture stored
including the whole Neko and tiddy room
so a decision was made to make a new room for all different pictures, be it nekos or thighs
its name was n tiddy
there exist very little images of neko and tiddy room

upon closer inspection you can find the neko and tiddy room references hidden away in plain sight
like quotes that were made in the room
