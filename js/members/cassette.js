As of the 2nd of May 2019 Cassette has become a Spicy sausage monarch
this title he gained after watching nisekoi
Cassette is the first non-founding person to become a Spicy sausage monarch
He first came to Lenny Faqs during the anime flooding from the anime party server
at first he wasnt active at all however
at first he was invited and after a few texts he went inactive which caused him to be kicked during the purge
he was later re-invited by Margareth and slowly started becoming more active
Cassette has way less history than other Spicy sausage monarchs because he only started being active in the ressurection era
he still is seen in a small amount of memes however

In the relatively small amount of time he was on the server he gained 2 roles made specifically for him
Capitalist nigger shrimp and americunt
the fact that he was from america and could buy basically anything he wished for a source of memes about him
