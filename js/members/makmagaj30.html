Magmakaj30 is one of the 3 Spicy sausage monarchs and the creator of Lenny Faqs
he is responcible for creating both the steam group and the discord group
during pre-anime flooding era he was very often seen talking about philosophy
this behavior left marks in Lenny Faqs which can be seen to this day

Magmakaj30 created the philosopher emojis
from all of the philosophers only one was able to become popular
that philosopher was Diogenes from Sinope
due to his cynicism and lack of care for the world he became like a mascot for Lenny Faqs
Magmakaj30 switched to using Diogenes for spamming when lennies were no longer used
the emoji was deleted and then later re-added 
finally the emote got its background removed and an off-shoot emoji with glowing eyes was added
Magmakaj30 is deemed as the arguing god of the server
he mostly didnt join the arguments that were happening unless he thought it would be funny
his skills in debating were used to make Dankmemess apologize to licht for attempting to roast him online

many memes were made to show the strengh of Magmakaj30's debating power

During the anime flooding Magmakaj30 took ownership of the thighs room
a room that was supposed to be a contender for the neko and tiddy room but due to lack of pillagers it never grew
it was later deleted along with neko and tiddy room
Magmakaj30 has a passion for collecting relatively useless skills
skills like flipping balisong knives, lockpicking or lucid dreaming
