On july 30th 2017 the group Lenny Fags was created, that moment marked a beggining of a new era for the Lenny Faqs 
Members were chosen based on randomness, knowledge about memes and other factors
in the end the group consisted of around 9 true members
not much is known about the steampunk era
all discussions were had in private messages and effectively lost to time
The group hovewer still stands and screenshots of it can be made
Image
here we can see the overview of the group
In its prime it had a few announcements made and a contest for the logo of the group
2 inactive members are left in the chat where nothing is said
Image
this is the post that started the Lenny Fags logo picture contest
many people were supposed to take place but from them only one actually took time to make anything
Image
Alex decided to make the only contending pictures
and won by default
Image
Image
From all of these, the first one was crowned as the winning picture and went on to be the symbol of the steampunk era of Lenny Faqs
Aside from the contest other things took place in the group like the somewhat lively comment section filled with terrified screams of the tortured being held captive in the group
Image
Many things took place in private messages, many of them had something to do with unfriending someone
effectively blocking all communication between the two
one of such cases ended in an apology letter that was written in modified old english
Image
Margareth throughout the ages couldn't keep one identity so his name changed quite frequently
this was confusing for new members and infuriating for the old ones
so it was fixed by giving him an official name
Image
from that moment on his name was forever Margareth, no matter how much he hated it
a curse he brought upon himself
Reading the posts many different types of lenny can be seen
thats due to the handcrafted collection of lennies that was one of the Lenny Fags big monuments
Image
each of them was given a name and a quote
and many were used as the default spamming lenny throughout the times
Everything was going great in the Lenny Fags
people were talking and memes were shared
but Magmakaj30 was not satisfied
he wished for a group chat that everyone went to
a place to get everything in one place
and he found the perfect place to migrate the group to
that place was discord
Image
quickly a server was made
it did not catch on quickly though
even if someone joined they did not stay active
the begginings were not easy
through determination some of the members joined the server 
some left
Sending the link in the post marked a new era in the story of Lenny Faqs
