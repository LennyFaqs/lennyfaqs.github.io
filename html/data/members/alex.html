Alex also known as the grammar nazi is one of the 3 Spicy sausage monarchs
in the pre-fag and steampunk era he was known as an anime god but the title soon was given to Margareth
but soon Alex found a new talent
that talent was being a grammar nazi
he was able to find anything wrong with what you said
that caused many memes to be made

The most well known of them was the nazi Alex meme

that meme was used for the logo of the Mein kampf server which was later turned into the emoji testing zone
that picture was also often used as a reply to Alex when he tried to correct someone
Alex's grammar correction went to such heights that a channel was created just to store the spelling mistakes
yet the channel never became more than a meme which quickly died

Alex is known for arguing with Margareth from time to time
most of the time it ends with either one of them leaving the server for some time before rejoining
one such argument did not however end in just leaving the server but in deleting the neko and tiddy room
Alex is the main person to bring suicide videos to Lenny Faqs and was the only one to be sad about
eventually he stopped caring too however
he searched around liveleak for a small amount of time which made him weak to gore
that can be weaponized against him if needed
Alex's face can be often seen throughout the server in either memes or even a set of emojis made by him

these emojis can be found in Lenny Faqs to this day
