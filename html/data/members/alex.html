        Alex also known as the grammar nazi is one of the 3 Spicy sausage monarchs<br>
        in the pre-fag and steampunk era he was known as an anime god but the title soon was given to Margareth<br>
        but soon Alex found a new talent<br>
        that talent was being a grammar nazi<br>
        he was able to find anything wrong with what you said<br>
        that caused many memes to be made<br>
        The most well known of them was the nazi Alex meme<br>

        that meme was used for the logo of the Mein kampf server which was later turned into the emoji testing zone<br>
        that picture was also often used as a reply to Alex when he tried to correct someone<br>
        Alex's grammar correction went to such heights that a channel was created just to store the spelling mistakes<br>
        yet the channel never became more than a meme which quickly died<br>

        Alex is known for arguing with Margareth from time to time<br>
        most of the time it ends with either one of them leaving the server for some time before rejoining<br>
        one such argument did not however end in just leaving the server but in deleting the neko and tiddy room<br>
        Alex is the main person to bring suicide videos to Lenny Faqs and was the only one to be sad about<br>
        eventually he stopped caring too however<br>
        he searched around liveleak for a small amount of time which made him weak to gore<br>
        that can be weaponized against him if needed<br>
        Alex's face can be often seen throughout the server in either memes or even a set of emojis made by him<br>
