<p>Ryuggo was doing Dark Souls 3 Pvp with Doggo and was adding people that fought well<br>
Out of the 9 persons he fought, he missed click 1 of them and didn't add him<br>
This person was Margareth<br>
Hopefully Doggo didn't miss clicked him and has already engaged a conversation with him<br>
The next day, Doggo introduced Bobo to Ryuggo, and the Lennys Steam Group followed soon after<br>
Magmakaj asked both of them a question to grant them the access to the group<br>
"Who's the best waifu?"<br>
At the time, his profile picture was an Onodera pic<br>
As Doggo saw this anime, he was able to answer, but that was not the case for Ryuggo..<br>
Who brilliantly cheated Magmakaj by asking Doggo the answer<br>
They soon moved on from Steam to join the already dead Discord server<br>
With the arrival of the two, Margareth started talking on the discord too, igniting the first spark of life and marking the end of the Steampunk Era<br>

Ur blue, there you go role is a role that have a pretty long story, and a running gag attached to it<br>
It was made by Ryuggo, who didn't want to have the same role as others, and an "ugly color" using his own words<br>
This role has been updated a lot through the era, but Ryuggo fought for it as much as he can, and won all the fights<br>
It first started because of another role -which the name is lost- that Ryuggo didn't accept as his true identity<br>
Magmakaj ask him to make 3 emojis to earn it, which he did<br>

The Lenny's irl face's emojis were born to this day, only a few of them survived the time<br>
It happened often that magmakaj changed the role for optimisation or organisation, which Ryuggo didn't like at all<br>

During the anime flooding, some roles were made to differentiate the old faqs from the newcomers<br>
Magmakaj made a dilemma to Ryuggo<br>
To choose between the old faqs role, and the blue one<br>
Ryuggo went victory with both roles in hand, we still don't know how<br>
Probably thanks to Magmakaj generosity<br>

In the past, some have tried to have a different role, to be more unique, as the blue role made them envious of it<br>
Alas for them, there could be only one, and Magmakaj was sever but just about that<br>

Here's an explanation of the blue role to a newcomer<br>
Simple, short, effective<br>

One day though, another fag had some unique role too, which was blue, a bit darker than the original one, but still, it was already too much for Ryuggo<br>
As the main possessor of the blue role, and the unique colored role, he had to choose some punishment for the fag who stole his role, Cassette<br>

During the Resurection Era, Ryuggo was given the ability to rank up to the spicy monarchs of the Lennys<br>
But he declined the offer, as it would have removed his true form, the blue color<br>
