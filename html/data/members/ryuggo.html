<p>Ryuggo was doing Dark Souls 3 Pvp with Doggo and was adding people that fought well<br>
Out of the 9 persons he fought, he missed click 1 of them and didn't add him<br>
This person was Margareth<br>
Hopefully Doggo didn't miss clicked him and has already engaged a conversation with him<br>
The next day, Doggo introduced Bobo to Ryuggo, and the Lennys Steam Group followed soon after<br>
Magmakaj asked both of them a question to grant them the access to the group<br>
"Who's the best waifu?"<br>
At the time, his profile picture was an Onodera pic<br>
As Doggo saw this anime, he was able to answer, but that was not the case for Ryuggo..<br>
Who brilliantly cheated Magmakaj by asking Doggo the answer<br>
They soon moved on from Steam to join the already dead Discord server<br>
With the arrival of the two, Margareth started talking on the discord too, igniting the first spark of life and making an end to the Steampunk Era<br>

Ryuggo along with Doggo have joined at the same time
they joined at the very end of the steampunk era
Ryuggo is the french representation of Lenny Faqs also the youtuber/streamer of Lenny Faqs
he has created a youtube channel by the name of PotaTeam
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqR0YXF1NAlavYualHIleAg
where he uploads both gameplay in both english and french
the only english series is the monster hunter: world series where he can be seen playing with Margareth
Doggo isnt nearly as active as Ryuggo but he has been seen uploading pictures to the neko and tiddy room while it still existed

Ur blue, there you go role is a role that have a pretty long story, and a running gag attached to it<br>
Its was made by Ryuggo, who didn't want to have the same role as others, and an "ugly color" in his opinion<br>
This role has been updated a lot through the era, but Ryuggo fought for it as much as he can, and won all the fight<br>
It first started because of another role -which the name is unknown from me- that Ryuggaj didn't accept as his true identity<br>
Magmakaj ask him to make 3 emojis to earn it, which he did<br>
The Lenny's irl face's emojis were born to this day, only a few of them survived the time<br>

It happened often that magmakaj changed the role for optimisation or organisation, which Ryuggo didn't like at all<br>

During the anime flooding, some roles were made to differentiate the old faqs from the newcomers<br>
Magmakaj made a dilemma for Ryuggo to choose between the old faqs role, and the blue one<br>
Ryuggo went victory with both roles in hand, we still don't know how, probably thanks to Magmakaj generosity<br>

In the past, some tried to have a different role, to be more unique, as the blue role made them envious of it<br>
Alas for them, there could be only one, and Magmakaj was sever but just about that<br>

Here's an explanation of the blue role to a newcomer<br>
Simple, short, effective<br>

One day though, another fag had some unique role too, which was blue, a bit darker than the original one, but still, it was already too much for Ryuggo<br>
As the main possessor of the blue role, and the unique color role, he had to choose some punishment for the fag who stole his role, Cassette<br>

During the resurection era, Ryuggo was given the ability to rank up to the spicy monarchs of the Lennys<br>
But he declined the offer, as it would have removed his true form, the blue color<br>
