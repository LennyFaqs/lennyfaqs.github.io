<p>Magmakaj30 is one of the 3 Spicy sausage monarchs and the creator of Lenny Faqs<br>
he is responcible for creating both the steam group and the discord group<br>
during pre-anime flooding era he was very often seen talking about philosophy<br>
this behavior left marks in Lenny Faqs which can be seen to this day<br>

Magmakaj30 created the philosopher emojis<br>
from all of the philosophers only one was able to become popular<br>
that philosopher was Diogenes from Sinope<br>
due to his cynicism and lack of care for the world he became like a mascot for Lenny Faqs<br>
Magmakaj30 switched to using Diogenes for spamming when lennies were no longer used<br>
the emoji was deleted and then later re-added <br>
finally the emote got its background removed and an off-shoot emoji with glowing eyes was added<br>
Magmakaj30 is deemed as the arguing god of the server<br>
he mostly didnt join the arguments that were happening unless he thought it would be funny<br>
his skills in debating were used to make Dankmemess apologize to licht for attempting to roast him online<br>

During the anime flooding Magmakaj30 took ownership of the thighs room<br>
a room that was supposed to be a contender for the neko and tiddy room but due to lack of pillagers it never grew<br>
it was later deleted along with neko and tiddy room<br>
Magmakaj30 has a passion for collecting relatively useless skills<br>
skills like flipping balisong knives, lockpicking or lucid dreaming</p>
