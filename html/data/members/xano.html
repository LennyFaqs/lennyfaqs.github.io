        Xano is one of the most memorable member despite his absence<br>
        He's seen even less than Ron<br>
        practically non-existant on the server<br>
        due to that not much is known about him<br>
        he was most active in the steampunk era where he was online almost daily<br>
        soon however he vanished from steam and only resurfaced a handful of times on the discord server
