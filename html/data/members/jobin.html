        Margareth also know as The Sauce Man is one of the 3 Spicy sausage monarchs<br>
        he was the father of pillaging during the anime flooding era and can find anything, anywhere<br>
        he did not however start with this power<br>
        back in the pre-fag era he was no more than a mere mortal<br>
        during that time Alex was known as the god of anime amongst the Lenny Faqs due to his long list of watched anime <br>
        but that was slowly changing<br>
        both Margareth and Magmakaj30 were watching more and more anime<br>
        at first Magmakaj30 was regarded to be more knowledgeable than Margareth<br>
        what he lacked in knowledge he made up with persistance<br>
        when the other monarchs were bored and played games, Margareth kept watching anime and growing stronger<br>
        due to that he quickly overtook Magmakaj30 and finally Alex<br>
        one of the first places where Margareth showed his powers was on a facebook anime group<br>
        <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/571617987296100353/571620062121951263/unknown.png"><br>
        from that point on Margareth was sometimes called The Sauce man<br>
        giving sources was his speciality<br>
        but a new talent was about to be born<br>
        Margareth decided to start a folder that was called The E folder<br>
        there were stored all memes, templates and nekos<br>
        no one truly knew the size or the contents of The E folder except for Margareth himself<br>
        Any meme that was posted on Lenny Faqs was saved in The E folder<br>
        attempts to make an E folder of his own were made by Magmakaj30 to no avail<br>
        the job of finding sources and keeping the memes were given to Margareth<br>
        he was now famous for his abilities and was well known as The Sauce Man<br>
        his abilities also meant that he had a monopoly on the nekos in the server<br>
        all the nekos were save in the E folder while yugaj and negaj all left the server<br>
        the threats to delete the nekos turned into a reality when the neko and tiddy room was deleted<br>
        <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/571617987296100353/571623760940236801/unknown.png"><br>
        At one point in time though The Sauce Man fell lower than he ever did since he lost his dead of night<br>
        that was the day the The E folder was deleted<br>
        all the hard work from it was lost<br>
        Margareth was ready to give up on rebuilding it<br>
        but luckily he was able to find the strengh to go on<br>
        and thus The Dukes Archives were created<br>
        to help the archives grow a channel called The Archive Donations was made<br>
        all memes posted there were sent to the archives and all the nekos to then still existing neko and tiddy room were downloaded<br>
        multiple thousand images of nekos<br>
        After seeing what happened to The E folder Magmakaj30 decided to help Margareth by sending him a multi part series of phone cleaning memes from imgur<br>
        few hundred memes were sent in the span of few minutes<br>
        the memes from these phone cleaning dumps are so old that the memes in them can be seen in the pre-anime flooding era<br>
        Now The Archives are bigger than The E folder ever was<br>
        similarly The Sauce Man is stronger than he ever was<br>
        Depresso Espresso — 05/05/2019<br>
        On the 29th of April 2019 Margareth deleted the Diogenes bot and kept deleting it once readded since it was said it would become the new way of finding sauce<br>
        all the things he has done up untill this point added up<br>
        deleting the neko room, deleting the Diogenes bot<br>
        and other lesser things finally caused Margareth to loose his status as a Spicy sausage monarch<br>
        he is now considered a Forsaken sausage monarch
