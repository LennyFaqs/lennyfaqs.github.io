<p>Magmakaj30 at one point kept using amino<br>
everything was normal and there werent any connections of amino to Lenny Faqs<br>
untill one day that Magmakaj30 met kakky<br>
Magmakaj30 was in a community called Pagans & Witches, one of the biggest communities for pagans on amino<br>
there he would make chatrooms for lucid dreaming, astral projections and other stuff<br>
one day however he was messaged by a person he didnt know<br>
he said, that Magmakaj30 looked like a good person after which he invited him to a private community<br>
that community was called The Dark Forest<br>
that place was filled to the brim with furries, otherkin and other people who were delusional even by Magmakaj30's standards<br>
he did not leave however<br>
instead he wanted to see if there were some sensible people in the place<br>
the person that added him seemed like one<br>
that person was also the admin<br>

Magmakaj30 entered the main hangout chat and started talking to people<br>
most people seemed normal<br>
most, because there was one person that stood out<br>
Depresso Espresso â€” 05/05/2019<br>
that one person was Kakyoin<br>
he seemed normal at first but then Magmakaj30 asked "are you actually kakyoin from jojo?"<br>
to which he replied with a sigh and an explanation of how there are multiple ghosts in his body and that the original soul of the body is gone and that he is kakyoin and yada yada yada<br>
Kakky was hilarious<br>
Magmakaj30 quickly started messing with him<br>
which led him to be kicked<br>
Magmakaj30 at that moment realized that Kakky was a mod in this community<br>
Magmakaj30 was then contacted by the same admin that he was invited by<br>
mystic told him to be careful with Kakky, because he can kick people with little to no reason<br>
after that he was invited to the chatroom once more<br>
things went on as usual<br>
untill kakky decided to strike once again<br>
yet another argument broke out between Kakky and Magmakaj30<br>
Magmakaj30 was once again kicked from the chatroom<br>
he was scolded for making the same mistake and once again invited to the chat again<br>
after a while same thing happened once again which ended up in a ban<br>
normally that would be the end of a story<br>
not this time however<br>
Magmakaj30 was given a last chance<br>
he was unbanned and said no more inviting and unbanning will be done<br>
Magmakaj30 started investigating and gathering information on Kakky<br>
Many things were found due to that<br>

the most notable find however was Kakkys deviantart profile<br>
Magmakaj30 made an account on deviantart to get in touch with kakky<br>
that account was called Pestilence30<br>
a small nod to the faq mythos<br>
Magmakaj30 succesfully managed to add kakky on discord where he resides to this day<br>
time passes by as nothing is done, no one knows what to do with kakky<br>
a chat filled with fake messages was made where kakky was supposed to be added, but that never happened<br>
the chatroom is called main chat and is still in Lenny Faqs to this day<br>
To remember Kakky an emoji was made<br>
