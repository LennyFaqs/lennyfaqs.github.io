<p>As of the 2nd of May 2019 Cassette has become a Spicy sausage monarch<br>
this title he gained after watching nisekoi<br>
Cassette is the first non-founding person to become a Spicy sausage monarch<br>
He first came to Lenny Faqs during the anime flooding from the anime party server<br>
at first he wasnt active at all however<br>
at first he was invited and after a few texts he went inactive which caused him to be kicked during the purge<br>
he was later re-invited by Margareth and slowly started becoming more active<br>
Cassette has way less history than other Spicy sausage monarchs because he only started being active in the ressurection era<br>
he still is seen in a small amount of memes however<br>

In the relatively small amount of time he was on the server he gained 2 roles made specifically for him<br>
Capitalist nigger shrimp and americunt<br>
the fact that he was from america and could buy basically anything he wished for a source of memes about him</p>
