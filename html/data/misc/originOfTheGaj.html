        Ryuggo was the first member to add gaj in the nickname, using magmakaj as first victim, as his name was already well made to be conversed into the mighty Gaj family<br>

        Magmakaj is the one who decided to implement Gaj in each nickname's members of the server to bound all of us in the Lenny's family<br>

        Once, Margareth had to explain to some fellow ignorant the meaning of the Gaj, thus, he took some of his precious time to write down one of the verse of the lost Faggy Bible, which will one day, be returned to its all mighty greatness</p>
        <p>"Gajness is the highest form of status one person can achieve over their lives in the land of LennyFaqs, such a person is respected by everyone, while at the same time, also hated just as much, basically its a title that would go to the best of the best in LennyFaqs"<br>
        "The history goes all the way back to the unknown age of spring 2018 where a man found a meme of a manga "Berserk", he saw great potential in a meme that stated "I'm not gaj" and thus, it became somewhat of a joke over the time, till it finally became another term for a member of LennyFaqs, the true origins of this meme go back to Berserk 1997 and a video about it, though most know it as a meme that came out from my random bullshit i made up a while ago"<br>
        "Such a title shall be bestowed only upon the most valuable of fags, in this case including Ryuggo, considering he read Berserk"<br>
