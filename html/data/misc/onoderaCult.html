        There were many goddesses on Lenny Faqs throughout the ages<br>
        goddesses like komi or senko-san<br>
        but none were relevant for as long as Onodera<br>

        The beggining of the Onodera cult stretch back to the steampunk era where Magmakaj30 first watched nisekoi<br>
        nisekoi easily became a favorite of Magmakaj30 and Onodera became his one and only waifu<br>
        at first only Magmakaj30 was in the Lenny Faqs Onodera cult<br>
        Margareth didnt care<br>
        and Alex didnt watch nisekoi back then<br>
        that did not however stop Magmakaj30 from making an Onodera emote in the pre-anime flooding era<br>
        few attempts were made before finding the image that can be found in Lenny Faqs to this day<br>

        Onodera became the goddess of Lenny Faqs<br>
        even going as far as creating a badge that allowed people to access vip chatrooms during the anime flooding era<br>
        that was a unique badge that was called the Onoderas Blessing<br>
        its believed that it was never used in the short time that it existed<br>
        Being such a big part of Lenny Faqs it was inevitable that she would soon be memed<br>

        these memes were called herecy by Magmakaj30 but still were saved by some of the fags and thus were able to be found in this day and age<br>
        Goddess Onodera also appeared in the parody game of Magmakaj30 as an easter egg where a secret room was able to be found that had onodera pictures in it and all of the jojo openings that were available back in the day <br>
        many mentions of Onodera can be found throughout the server <br>

        Onodera was even present in the now gone neko and tiddy room<br>
        <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/571605232426024961/571612490379821056/unknown.png"><br>
        these images were later uploaded to n tiddy where they can be found to this day
