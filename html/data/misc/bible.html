<p>Give me a raise plz</p>
<p>"Gajness is the highest form of status one person can achieve over their lives in the land of LennyFaqs, such a person is respected by everyone, while at the same time, also hated just as much, basically its a title that would go to the best of the best in LennyFaqs"</p>
<p>"The history goes all the way back to the unknown age of spring 2018 where a man found a meme of a manga "Berserk", he saw great potential in a meme that stated "I'm not gaj" and thus, it became somewhat of a joke over the time, till it finally became another term for a member of LennyFaqs, the true origins of this meme go back to Berserk 1997 and a video about it, though most know it as a meme that came out from my random bullshit i made up a while ago"</p>
<p>"Such a title shall be bestowed only upon the most valuable of fags, in this case including Ryuggo, considering he read Berserk"</p>
