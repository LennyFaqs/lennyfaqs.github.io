<p>During the steampunk era and early pre-anime flooding era lennies were the primary way to express your emotions by spamming them<br>
the more the funnier something was<br>
the same lennies could become stale after a bit so a library was created<br>
Image<br>
later a second lenny library was found somewhere else which was stolen and put up in Lenny Faqs server by Ryuggo<br>
Image<br>
even with this many lennies the server started switching over to emojis<br>
some early day emojis are still being used or some modified form of them is<br>

From these only the lenny emoji still exists in a modified form but is no longer used<br>
as time went on emojies in Lenny Faqs went from random pictures added as emojies for a meme to specifically used meme for an emoji<br>
and that still doesnt work sometimes<br>
but occasionally an emoji is added that becomes an emoji thats used multiple times a day<br>
some early examples of that is ainsley and guts<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
to this day they can be seen used<br>
throughout time more smug face have been added with varying amounts of succes <br>
the most popular smug emoji as of today is the michael emoji<br>
Image<br>
but not all succesful emojies are smug emojies, there are some other emojies that have achieved success while expressing other feelings<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
from shock through sadness to not caring these emojis have it all<br>
Some emojies were made specifically for the purpose of showing a meme that wouldnt normally work with just one image<br>
so the image was split into two<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
with the limited space of only 50 emojis and 50 animated emojis Lenny Faqs couldnt store all of its idea on one server so the nuclear testing zone was created<br>
a server for testing, storing and keeping emojis<br>
the server is used to keep record of all used emojis that had to be removed, to make space for new ones</p>
