<p>Lenny Faqs mythos were stories created by the Spicy sausage monarchs depicting the server and their members<br>
the mythos mainly focused on the Spicy sausage monarchs but other people occasionally can be seen in them too<br>
One of the first incarnations of the mythos were the 3 horsemen of the apocalypse<br>
the Spicy sausage monarchs were also known as the 3 pillars or the pillarmen<br>
Magmakaj30 was known as pestilence<br>
Margareth was known as the conquest<br>
Alex was known as famine<br>

a profile on tumblr named as Pestilence30 was made by Magmakaj30<br>
the profile had the job of luring a certain person to Lenny Faqs but the plan never worked out in the end<br>
a fourth horseman was proposed to have existed long ago that was killed and replaced by Diogenes the bot<br>
it was supposed to be the death<br>
face of Diogenes can be seen in multiple memes shown above<br>
either as a seperate person or in a way a part of pestilence<br>
where pestilance came death followed</p>
