a profile on tumblr named as Pestilence30 was made by Magmakaj30<br>
the profile had the job of luring a certain person to Lenny Faqs but the plan never worked out in the end<br>
a fourth horseman was proposed to have existed long ago that was killed and replaced by Diogenes the bot<br>
it was supposed to be the death<br>
face of Diogenes can be seen in multiple memes shown above<br>
either as a seperate person or in a way a part of pestilence<br>
where pestilance came death followed</p>
