There were many goddesses on Lenny Faqs throughout the ages
goddesses like komi or senko-san
but none were relevant for as long as Onodera
Image
The beggining of the Onodera cult stretch back to the steampunk era where Magmakaj30 first watched nisekoi
nisekoi easily became a favorite of Magmakaj30 and Onodera became his one and only waifu
at first only Magmakaj30 was in the Lenny Faqs Onodera cult
Margareth didnt care
and Alex didnt watch nisekoi back then
that did not however stop Magmakaj30 from making an Onodera emote in the pre-anime flooding era
few attempts were made before finding the image that can be found in Lenny Faqs to this day
Image
Image
Onodera became the goddess of Lenny Faqs
even going as far as creating a badge that allowed people to access vip chatrooms during the anime flooding era
that was a unique badge that was called the Onoderas Blessing
its believed that it was never used in the short time that it existed
Being such a big part of Lenny Faqs it was inevitable that she would soon be memed

these memes were called herecy by Magmakaj30 but still were saved by some of the fags and thus were able to be found in this day and age
Goddess Onodera also appeared in the parody game of Magmakaj30 as an easter egg where a secret room was able to be found that had onodera pictures in it and all of the jojo openings that were available back in the day 
many mentions of Onodera can be found throughout the server 
Image
Onodera was even present in the now gone neko and tiddy room
Image
these images were later uploaded to n tiddy where they can be found to this day
