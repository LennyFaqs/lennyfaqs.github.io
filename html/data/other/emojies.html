During the steampunk era and early pre-anime flooding era lennies were the primary way to express your emotions by spamming them
the more the funnier something was
the same lennies could become stale after a bit so a library was created
Image
later a second lenny library was found somewhere else which was stolen and put up in Lenny Faqs server by Ryuggo
Image
even with this many lennies the server started switching over to emojis
some early day emojis are still being used or some modified form of them is

From these only the lenny emoji still exists in a modified form but is no longer used
as time went on emojies in Lenny Faqs went from random pictures added as emojies for a meme to specifically used meme for an emoji
and that still doesnt work sometimes
but occasionally an emoji is added that becomes an emoji thats used multiple times a day
some early examples of that is ainsley and guts
Image
Image
to this day they can be seen used
throughout time more smug face have been added with varying amounts of succes 
the most popular smug emoji as of today is the michael emoji
Image
but not all succesful emojies are smug emojies, there are some other emojies that have achieved success while expressing other feelings
Image
Image
Image
Image
Image
from shock through sadness to not caring these emojis have it all
Some emojies were made specifically for the purpose of showing a meme that wouldnt normally work with just one image
so the image was split into two
Image
Image
Image
Image
with the limited space of only 50 emojis and 50 animated emojis Lenny Faqs couldnt store all of its idea on one server so the nuclear testing zone was created
a server for testing, storing and keeping emojis
the server is used to keep record of all used emojis that had to be removed, to make space for new ones
