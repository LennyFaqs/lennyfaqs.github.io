<p>Early times of the discord server were rough and barely anyone talked<br>
the first ones to join were the 3 spicy sausage monarchs and ron<br>
Image<br>
Even thought the discord server was made on August 24th 2017 any sort of talking didnt start untill 4 months later<br>
early days consisted of sending memes and making comments on them unless some other more intresting topic came up<br>
most of the day the server was dead silent<br>
Apart from the main channel that was around since the very beggining of the server to now, there were many other channels which contents have been lost<br>
among the early channels were rons playground or a bit later the loli room<br>
at the time also the neko and tiddy room was created<br>
a room that went on to become a legendary room filled with more nekos that one man could ever want<br>
during the pre-anime flooding era lenny spamming was still very much popular<br>
yet it was a thing that was quickly abandoned for emojis made by the Lenny Faqs members<br>
here are some of the emojis from early days that have not made it to today<br>

Early day emojis were mostly parodies of already existing emojis or spongebob memes<br>
they however did not survive the passage of time<br>
but there was one more emoji that decided to challange fate<br>
Image<br>
the lenny emoji<br>
a convenient way to lenny spam<br>
there were many incarnations of this emoji but all failed in the end<br>
During the pre-anime flooding period Margareths powers began to manifest as the sauce man<br>
his early days of finding and sharing sauce were on facebook anime group where he would tell people the source of anime memes<br>
Image<br>
apart from lennies another meme was developing into a staple of the servers culture<br>
it was called gaj<br>
it originated from a <a href="https://youtu.be/G9wEcdJcQd0?t=11">berserk parody video</a><br>
YouTube<br>
Dr.Spacetime<br>
Berserk (1997) in a nutshell<br>
<br>
the face of guts became an emoji after that but after some time it got deleted due to lack of use<br>
Image<br>
that was also the time when the original philosopher emojis were made<br>
Image<br>
from all of the emojis only Diogenes went on to become a well known and used emoji<br>
Image<br>
The pre-anime flooding era was a time of rapid growth, new channels were being made, some of them would go on to become well know treasure of the Lenny Faqs history<br>
<br>
But all good things eventually have to end, and so did the pre-anime flooding era<br>
Margareth was chatting more on a public server known as Anime Party<br>
without his energy to talk about anything anywhere at anytime Lenny Faqs were left feeling empty<br>
to fix that Magmakaj30 tried to lure Margareth back to Lenny Faqs to no avail<br>
finally a compromise was proposed by Margareth<br>
his idea was to get the best people from Anime Party into Lenny Faqs<br>
he decided to set this plan into motion on the 15th of July 2018</p>
