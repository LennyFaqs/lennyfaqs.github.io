Early times of the discord server were rough and barely anyone talked
the first ones to join were the 3 spicy sausage monarchs and ron
Image
Even thought the discord server was made on August 24th 2017 any sort of talking didnt start untill 4 months later

early days consisted of sending memes and making comments on them unless some other more intresting topic came up
most of the day the server was dead silent
Apart from the main channel that was around since the very beggining of the server to now, there were many other channels which contents have been lost
among the early channels were rons playground or a bit later the loli room
at the time also the neko and tiddy room was created
a room that went on to become a legendary room filled with more nekos that one man could ever want
during the pre-anime flooding era lenny spamming was still very much popular
yet it was a thing that was quickly abandoned for emojis made by the Lenny Faqs members
here are some of the emojis from early days that have not made it to today

Early day emojis were mostly parodies of already existing emojis or spongebob memes
they however did not survive the passage of time
but there was one more emoji that decided to challange fate
Image
the lenny emoji
a convenient way to lenny spam
there were many incarnations of this emoji but all failed in the end
During the pre-anime flooding period Margareths powers began to manifest as the sauce man
his early days of finding and sharing sauce were on facebook anime group where he would tell people the source of anime memes
Image
apart from lennies another meme was developing into a staple of the servers culture
it was called gaj
it originated from a berserk parody video

Dr.Spacetime
Berserk (1997) in a nutshell

the face of guts became an emoji after that but after some time it got deleted due to lack of use
Image
that was also the time when the original philosopher emojis were made
Image
from all of the emojis only Diogenes went on to become a well known and used emoji
Image
The pre-anime flooding era was a time of rapid growth, new channels were being made, some of them would go on to become well know treasure of the Lenny Faqs history

But all good things eventually have to end, and so did the pre-anime flooding era
Margareth was chatting more on a public server known as Anime Party
without his energy to talk about anything anywhere at anytime Lenny Faqs were left feeling empty
to fix that Magmakaj30 tried to lure Margareth back to Lenny Faqs to no avail
finally a compromise was proposed by Margareth
his idea was to get the best people from Anime Party into Lenny Faqs
he decided to set this plan into motion on the 15th of July 2018
