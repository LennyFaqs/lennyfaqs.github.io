<p>On july 30th 2017 the group Lenny Fags was created, that moment marked a beggining of a new era for the Lenny Faqs <br>
Members were chosen based on randomness, knowledge about memes and other factors<br>
in the end the group consisted of around 9 true members<br>
not much is known about the steampunk era<br>
all discussions were had in private messages and effectively lost to time<br>
The group hovewer still stands and screenshots of it can be made<br>

here we can see the overview of the group<br>
In its prime it had a few announcements made and a contest for the logo of the group<br>
2 inactive members are left in the chat where nothing is said<br>

this is the post that started the Lenny Fags logo picture contest<br>
many people were supposed to take place but from them only one actually took time to make anything<br>

Alex decided to make the only contending pictures<br>
and won by default<br>

From all of these, the first one was crowned as the winning picture and went on to be the symbol of the steampunk era of Lenny Faqs<br>
Aside from the contest other things took place in the group like the somewhat lively comment section filled with terrified screams of the tortured being held captive in the group<br>

Many things took place in private messages, many of them had something to do with unfriending someone<br>
effectively blocking all communication between the two<br>
one of such cases ended in an apology letter that was written in modified old english<br>

Margareth throughout the ages couldn't keep one identity so his name changed quite frequently<br>
this was confusing for new members and infuriating for the old ones<br>
so it was fixed by giving him an official name<br>

from that moment on his name was forever Margareth, no matter how much he hated it<br>
a curse he brought upon himself<br>
Reading the posts many different types of lenny can be seen<br>
thats due to the handcrafted collection of lennies that was one of the Lenny Fags big monuments<br>

each of them was given a name and a quote<br>
and many were used as the default spamming lenny throughout the times<br>
Everything was going great in the Lenny Fags<br>
people were talking and memes were shared<br>
but Magmakaj30 was not satisfied<br>
he wished for a group chat that everyone went to<br>
a place to get everything in one place<br>
and he found the perfect place to migrate the group to<br>
that place was discord<br>

quickly a server was made<br>
it did not catch on quickly though<br>
even if someone joined they did not stay active<br>
the begginings were not easy<br>
through determination some of the members joined the server <br>
some left<br>
