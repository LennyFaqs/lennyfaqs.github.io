<p>After the Purge on Lenny Faqs all rules were set back to how they were before the anime flooding, in other words, non existant<br>
there was no more ownership of rooms or badges <br>
you could ask to get any emoji added, and it would be if it seemed to be good enough<br>
the server gained more channels that had the purpose of sharing, unlike the neko and tiddy room or the glorious thighs room these rooms would share greentext stories or anime reccomendations<br>
all channels meant for sharing were put in the sharing is caring cattegory<br>
The server went back to being what it was meant to be<br>
a free for all place to do anything you want<br>
laugh with friends or sell cocaine, all was alright in Lenny Faqs<br>
(for legal reasons thats a joke)<br>
the server gained two new members, yugaj and negaj the neko uploaders<br>
the server also got a bot that was named Diogenes the gaj dog<br>
for some time some people thought that Diogenes the bot would replace the neko uploaders but that never happened<br>
Things seemed to go back to how they were in pre-anime flooding period with some small changes for the better<br>
a few new people joined<br>
like john who later made a whole channel for lyric translations from croatian to english<br>

or Cassette who became one of the regularly talking people<br>
he was also present for some time in the anime flooding since he was from Anime Party but was kicked due to inactivity during The Purge<br>
after being added again he started talking more and more finally becoming the most talkative non-spicy sausage monarch<br>
Dankmemess asked to be let into Lenny Faqs again, but even after being accepted he became inactive on the server<br>
Many other people have joined after seeing that they fit in, but many of them almost never talk leaving the spicy sausage monarchs and cassette the only active ones plus ryuggo or even doggo sometimes to drop in<br>
not everything was going perfectly though<br>
yugaj was becoming less and less active<br>
and negaj outright left the server<br>
there were less and less nekos uploaded to the neko and tiddy room<br>
things seemed to dwindle a lot in Lenny Faqs <br>
Margareth would frequently leave and rejoin<br>
things were once again in bad shape<br>
then an argument broke out between Margareth and Alex that resulted in Margareth deleting the Neko and tiddy room on the 25th of March 2018 <br>
a room that many people worked on for a long time<br>
luckily Margareth already had the title of The Sauce Man<br>
meaning he could find anything, anywhere<br>
and that he had every single picture stored<br>
including the whole Neko and tiddy room<br>
so a decision was made to make a new room for all different pictures, be it nekos or thighs<br>
its name was n tiddy<br>
there exist very little images of neko and tiddy room<br>

upon closer inspection you can find the neko and tiddy room references hidden away in plain sight<br>
like quotes that were made in the room<br>
