<p>In the beggining there was nothing<br>
Lenny Faqs didnt yet exist and the spicy sausage monarch havent yet met<br>
Until one fated day<br>
In an age long gone one of the 3 spicy monarchs, called Magmakaj30 was playing tf2 when he suddenly got a trade offer<br>
the offer was a heavily discounted shitty medigun<br>
Magmakaj30 took it and decided to try acting like a toxic medic main for the rest of the match<br>
he started flooding the chat with things like "WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU FUCKING FAGS?", or "ITS ALL YOUR FAULT YOU FAGS"<br>
some found it annoying, some found it funny<br>
one person found it fucking hilarious<br>
that person was called Margareth<br>
he asked Magmakaj30 to add him, and soon they started chatting<br>
it was quite one sided, since Magmakaj30 couldnt care less about Margareth<br>
yet soon Magmakaj30 gave up and decided to chat too<br>
The word fag turned into a meme after what happened in tf2 and lenny spamming became insanely popular between these two<br>
they memed around untill one day when Margareth was acting depressed<br>
It turned out that he lost his dead of night<br>
which was expensive by his standards<br>
Magmakaj30 took it upon himself to get that back<br>
he was pointed to the profile of Alex<br>
The two of them began discussing what happened and what should be done<br>
almost by luck, Alex decided to give back the dead of night to Margareth<br>
and for some reason the 3 became friends<br>
Thats when a pact was made<br>
a cult was started<br>
a group was formed<br>
its name<br>
was Lenny Fags</p>
