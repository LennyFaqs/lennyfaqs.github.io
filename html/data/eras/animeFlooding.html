<p>On July 15th 2018 Margareth invited the first person from Anime Party to Lenny Faqs<br>
Image<br>
an event that would bring change to the server<br>
At first the idea seemed fine, since Lenny Faqs were getting more members and Margareth was being more active on the server<br>
but the influx of members changed the culture of the server itself<br>
not only that but more systems were put in place, some rules even<br>
Image<br>
A room for rules and things called badges was added<br>
The badges system worked on the basis of rewarding members for activity<br>
a system to keep them talking on the server<br>
there were multiple badges with multiple rewards<br>
from giving you the ability to add 1 emoji to the server all the way to becoming one of the higher people in the hierarchy and gaining access to premium chats<br>
only 2 badges were able to be found on the server<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
These two badges had a somewhat connected purpose<br>
In the anime flooding era the neko and tiddy room, thighs room and other ones that were made later on could be given an owner<br>
with the chatroom badge one could claim a room, effectively gaining more power over that room than the admin<br>
an owner could say what should be posted in the room and what wasnt allowed<br>
but the owner almost never was the one to look for images<br>
that was the role of the pillager<br>
an owner had the job of finding a pillager<br>
a pillager was a person responcible with finding new images for a room<br>
it was a job that everyone appreciated but no one wanted to to<br>
except for 3 people that would end up being the pillaging trio <br>
the first one of them was Margareth<br>
he was the original pillager for the neko room and could find giant amounts of nekos at once<br>
the other two people that searched for images were yuki and neko<br>
both of them were members of Anime Party but would become active members on Lenny Faqs during the anime flooding<br>
yuki, later called yugaj, was so good at searching for nekos that even Margareth at one point handed down the title of the neko pillager to her<br>
the ownership of the neko room was given to Alex who made sure to have only sfw nekos there, any other ones were deleted <br>
only exception he made was to preserve the photos from doggo, who was in japan and found hentai<br>
upon seeing the good quality of nekos posted by yugaj Margareth began being criticised for having bad nekos<br>
Magmakaj30 and Alex said that he prioritized quantity over quality<br>
which seemed to be true<br>
in an attempt to combat that Magmakaj30 tried to give advice to Margareth on how to find good nekos<br>
that sparked the legendary quote among the server<br>
Image<br>
neko room was thriving during the anime flooding but the same cant be said for the rest of the server<br>
new members that came from Anime Party fell under two group<br>
active and inactive<br>
most of the people that joined became inactive but some of them didnt<br>
two of the active people were yugaj and negaj (neko)<br>
but there were also active people that brought drama to the server<br>
one such person was Dankmemess<br>
Image<br>
Dankmemess was most known for bad taste in memes and occasionaly sending noodle hentai<br>
Image<br>
no one minded him since he didnt really do anything but that changed on the 6th of August 2018<br>
Dankmemess was kicked from Anime Party by Licht<br>
Image<br>
who was the admin on Anime Party and another person that Margareth added to Lenny Faqs<br>
that caused Dankmemess to become angry and try to make a roast video of Licht<br>
poorly made roasts aimed at his mother and the fact that Dankmemess was 11 or 12 didnt make for a good video<br>
in the video he then claimed to have made Licht cry when he was clearly laughing at him in the chat <br>
Dankmemess seemed to be proud of his video which he posted on youtube and sent the link to Lenny Faqs <br>
Magmakaj30 tried to talk it out with Dankmemess and give him a bit of a reality check<br>
after some time explaining that his roast video was a parody of itself and that he was simply put a fucking idiot<br>
Dankmemess realized he was wrong and decided to apologize to Licht<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
He was allowed back into Anime Party after that<br>
The anime flooding was also a time of creativity for the Spicy sausage monarchs who decided to meme themselves and thus made some of the most well known images on the server that can be seen anywhere<br>
Image<br>
Image<br>
Despite all the good things that were happening, everyone present there at the time could see that Lenny Faqs were crumbling<br>
the amount of people invited who were inactive from the very moment they joined was rising all the time<br>
so Magmakaj30 and Alex began scheming a plan to cleanse the server<br>
it was going to be called The Purge<br>
every inactive person from Anime Party was to be kicked<br>
and every person worthy of staying would be given a veteran role on the server for surviving that event<br>
Image<br>
Margareth was notified of the plan to kick all the inactive members and to delete the bots that were added in the meantime<br>
he didnt have faith that the server was going to last<br>
Image<br>
But the purge has already started on the 24th of August 2018<br>
<br>
Image<br>
The purge marked a new era for Lenny Faqs</p>
