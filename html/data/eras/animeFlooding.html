On July 15th 2018 Margareth invited the first person from Anime Party to Lenny Faqs
Image
an event that would bring change to the server
At first the idea seemed fine, since Lenny Faqs were getting more members and Margareth was being more active on the server
but the influx of members changed the culture of the server itself
not only that but more systems were put in place, some rules even
Image
A room for rules and things called badges was added
The badges system worked on the basis of rewarding members for activity
a system to keep them talking on the server
there were multiple badges with multiple rewards
from giving you the ability to add 1 emoji to the server all the way to becoming one of the higher people in the hierarchy and gaining access to premium chats
only 2 badges were able to be found on the server
Image
Image
These two badges had a somewhat connected purpose
In the anime flooding era the neko and tiddy room, thighs room and other ones that were made later on could be given an owner
with the chatroom badge one could claim a room, effectively gaining more power over that room than the admin
an owner could say what should be posted in the room and what wasnt allowed
but the owner almost never was the one to look for images
that was the role of the pillager
an owner had the job of finding a pillager
a pillager was a person responcible with finding new images for a room
it was a job that everyone appreciated but no one wanted to to
except for 3 people that would end up being the pillaging trio 
the first one of them was Margareth
he was the original pillager for the neko room and could find giant amounts of nekos at once
the other two people that searched for images were yuki and neko
both of them were members of Anime Party but would become active members on Lenny Faqs during the anime flooding
yuki, later called yugaj, was so good at searching for nekos that even Margareth at one point handed down the title of the neko pillager to her
the ownership of the neko room was given to Alex who made sure to have only sfw nekos there, any other ones were deleted 
only exception he made was to preserve the photos from doggo, who was in japan and found hentai
upon seeing the good quality of nekos posted by yugaj Margareth began being criticised for having bad nekos
Magmakaj30 and Alex said that he prioritized quantity over quality
which seemed to be true
in an attempt to combat that Magmakaj30 tried to give advice to Margareth on how to find good nekos
that sparked the legendary quote among the server
Image
neko room was thriving during the anime flooding but the same cant be said for the rest of the server
new members that came from Anime Party fell under two group
active and inactive
most of the people that joined became inactive but some of them didnt
two of the active people were yugaj and negaj (neko)
but there were also active people that brought drama to the server
one such person was Dankmemess
Image
Dankmemess was most known for bad taste in memes and occasionaly sending noodle hentai
Image
no one minded him since he didnt really do anything but that changed on the 6th of August 2018
Dankmemess was kicked from Anime Party by Licht
Image
who was the admin on Anime Party and another person that Margareth added to Lenny Faqs
that caused Dankmemess to become angry and try to make a roast video of Licht
poorly made roasts aimed at his mother and the fact that Dankmemess was 11 or 12 didnt make for a good video
in the video he then claimed to have made Licht cry when he was clearly laughing at him in the chat 
Dankmemess seemed to be proud of his video which he posted on youtube and sent the link to Lenny Faqs 
Magmakaj30 tried to talk it out with Dankmemess and give him a bit of a reality check
after some time explaining that his roast video was a parody of itself and that he was simply put a fucking idiot
Dankmemess realized he was wrong and decided to apologize to Licht
Image
Image
He was allowed back into Anime Party after that
The anime flooding was also a time of creativity for the Spicy sausage monarchs who decided to meme themselves and thus made some of the most well known images on the server that can be seen anywhere
Image
Image
Despite all the good things that were happening, everyone present there at the time could see that Lenny Faqs were crumbling
the amount of people invited who were inactive from the very moment they joined was rising all the time
so Magmakaj30 and Alex began scheming a plan to cleanse the server
it was going to be called The Purge
every inactive person from Anime Party was to be kicked
and every person worthy of staying would be given a veteran role on the server for surviving that event
Image
Margareth was notified of the plan to kick all the inactive members and to delete the bots that were added in the meantime
he didnt have faith that the server was going to last
Image
But the purge has already started on the 24th of August 2018

Image
The purge marked a new era for Lenny Faqs
