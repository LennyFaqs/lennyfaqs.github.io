Magmakaj30 at one point kept using amino
everything was normal and there werent any connections of amino to Lenny Faqs
untill one day that Magmakaj30 met kakky
Magmakaj30 was in a community called Pagans & Witches, one of the biggest communities for pagans on amino
there he would make chatrooms for lucid dreaming, astral projections and other stuff
one day however he was messaged by a person he didnt know
he said, that Magmakaj30 looked like a good person after which he invited him to a private community
that community was called The Dark Forest
that place was filled to the brim with furries, otherkin and other people who were delusional even by Magmakaj30's standards
he did not leave however
instead he wanted to see if there were some sensible people in the place
the person that added him seemed like one
that person was also the admin

Magmakaj30 entered the main hangout chat and started talking to people
most people seemed normal
most, because there was one person that stood out
Depresso Espresso â€” 05/05/2019
that one person was Kakyoin
he seemed normal at first but then Magmakaj30 asked "are you actually kakyoin from jojo?"
to which he replied with a sigh and an explanation of how there are multiple ghosts in his body and that the original soul of the body is gone and that he is kakyoin and yada yada yada
Kakky was hilarious
Magmakaj30 quickly started messing with him
which led him to be kicked
Magmakaj30 at that moment realized that Kakky was a mod in this community
Magmakaj30 was then contacted by the same admin that he was invited by
mystic told him to be careful with Kakky, because he can kick people with little to no reason
after that he was invited to the chatroom once more
things went on as usual
untill kakky decided to strike once again
yet another argument broke out between Kakky and Magmakaj30
Magmakaj30 was once again kicked from the chatroom
he was scolded for making the same mistake and once again invited to the chat again
after a while same thing happened once again which ended up in a ban
normally that would be the end of a story
not this time however
Magmakaj30 was given a last chance
he was unbanned and said no more inviting and unbanning will be done
Magmakaj30 started investigating and gathering information on Kakky
Many things were found due to that

the most notable find however was Kakkys deviantart profile
Magmakaj30 made an account on deviantart to get in touch with kakky
that account was called Pestilence30
a small nod to the faq mythos
Magmakaj30 succesfully managed to add kakky on discord where he resides to this day
time passes by as nothing is done, no one knows what to do with kakky
a chat filled with fake messages was made where kakky was supposed to be added, but that never happened
the chatroom is called main chat and is still in Lenny Faqs to this day
To remember Kakky an emoji was made
Image
its called Kakyointheautist and its in Lenny Faqs to this day
