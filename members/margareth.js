Margareth also know as The Sauce Man is one of the 3 Spicy sausage monarchs
he was the father of pillaging during the anime flooding era and can find anything, anywhere
he did not however start with this power
back in the pre-fag era he was no more than a mere mortal
during that time Alex was known as the god of anime amongst the Lenny Faqs due to his long list of watched anime 
but that was slowly changing
both Margareth and Magmakaj30 were watching more and more anime
at first Magmakaj30 was regarded to be more knowledgeable than Margareth
what he lacked in knowledge he made up with persistance
when the other monarchs were bored and played games, Margareth kept watching anime and growing stronger
due to that he quickly overtook Magmakaj30 and finally Alex
one of the first places where Margareth showed his powers was on a facebook anime group

from that point on Margareth was sometimes called The Sauce man
giving sources was his speciality
but a new talent was about to be born
Margareth decided to start a folder that was called The E folder
there were stored all memes, templates and nekos
no one truly knew the size or the contents of The E folder except for Margareth himself
Any meme that was posted on Lenny Faqs was saved in The E folder
attempts to make an E folder of his own were made by Magmakaj30 to no avail
the job of finding sources and keeping the memes were given to Margareth
he was now famous for his abilities and was well known as The Sauce Man
his abilities also meant that he had a monopoly on the nekos in the server
all the nekos were save in the E folder while yugaj and negaj all left the server
the threats to delete the nekos turned into a reality when the neko and tiddy room was deleted
Image
At one point in time though The Sauce Man fell lower than he ever did since he lost his dead of night
that was the day the The E folder was deleted
all the hard work from it was lost
Margareth was ready to give up on rebuilding it
but luckily he was able to find the strengh to go on
and thus The Dukes Archives were created
to help the archives grow a channel called The Archive Donations was made
all memes posted there were sent to the archives and all the nekos to then still existing neko and tiddy room were downloaded
multiple thousand images of nekos
After seeing what happened to The E folder Magmakaj30 decided to help Margareth by sending him a multi part series of phone cleaning memes from imgur
few hundred memes were sent in the span of few minutes
the memes from these phone cleaning dumps are so old that the memes in them can be seen in the pre-anime flooding era
Now The Archives are bigger than The E folder ever was
similarly The Sauce Man is stronger than he ever was

On the 29th of April 2019 Margareth deleted the Diogenes bot and kept deleting it once readded since it was said it would become the new way of finding sauce
all the things he has done up untill this point added up
deleting the neko room, deleting the Diogenes bot
and other lesser things finally caused Margareth to loose his status as a Spicy sausage monarch
he is now considered a Forsaken sausage monarch
